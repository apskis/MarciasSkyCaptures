Code Academy - Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox

# Overview
​This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the Internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.​

# Project Goals
In this project, you’ll be using flexbox to design and build the layout for a company’s homepage. You can choose to build a new homepage for an existing company or imagine your own dream company!​

# Lessons Learned:
- Flexbox is confusing but spending the time to do a wireframe of my thoughts and layout first made it much easier to understand flex containers at a top level.
- Settting up all flex containers first based on wireframe in css and html
- media queries should probably be thought out before the project begins, I didn't do this and it took my a long time to do the media stuff after I got the site looking great, but then as the browser was resized it looked aweful. 
- Start with mobile first, build mobile then go out, that would have saved me time. 
- Try to do as much as I can in css, keeping the html clean.
